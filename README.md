This is a fork of Gnometer 1.3.0.3 by poiru, from https://poiru.deviantart.com/art/Gnometer-1-3-0-3-182181512

I'll attempt to curate fixes where possible.  Large changes probably won't be possible without help from poiru though.

[Latest release.](https://github.com/Nightblade/Gnometer/releases/latest)

* **Word of the Day** skin fixed thanks to HarlekinGer.
* Fixed **CPU**s showing wrong usage amounts in **system** skins.
* Misc minor fixes including removing depreciated options/bangs.
