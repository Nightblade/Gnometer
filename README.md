This is a fork of Gnometer 1.3.0.3 by poiru, from https://poiru.deviantart.com/art/Gnometer-1-3-0-3-182181512

I'll attempt to curate fixes where possible.  Large changes probably won't be possible without help from poiru though.

[Latest release.](https://github.com/Nightblade/Gnometer/releases/latest)

## Change history:

* **Word of the Day** fixed thanks to HarlekinGer.

* Misc minor fixes including removing depreciated options/bangs.

## To do:

* **Media Player** Migrate other skins to built-in **NowPlaying** measure.
* **Weather** Investigate using LUA to make a local cache of the weather data so as to avoid unnecessary  web-scrapes (when using the Gnometer settings skin for example).
